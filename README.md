## A3 Planning

A3 planning is a technique created by Toyota and Lean manufacturing. The idea
is to focus on a problem and convey all the information necessary in an A3 
size of paper (11.69 x 16.53 inches). However,  it's not the size of the paper 
that is important but rather the approach to solving the problem and
conveying the right information to the people that need it.

### Background (PLAN)

This spike is an experiment in itself to test the viability of using AWS Lambda
functions (possibly Lambda@edge) to serve content from S3 to help eventually allow
us to retire Legacy. 
 
### Current condition (PLAN)

In the current system, [cnx-archive][cnx-archive] acts as a typical backend
web application. It exposes a web API that consumers use to get content for various books.
The web application queries the database ([cnx-db][cnx-db]) based on the request and returns
the appropriate response.

### Goal / Target Condition (PLAN)

1. There is an endpoint at archive.openstax.org (cloudfront) that returns content via lambda and s3.
2. Weâ€™ve got a book in s3 in the correct directory structure
3. We have the lambda function that can serve the book
4. ?
5. PROFIT

### Root Cause Analysis (PLAN)

Root cause analysis done at length within the [Archive vision 2 pager][rap-two-pager].

In summary, there are complications due to archive supplying content in various states ie. raw, baked, unbaked, etc.
The various states of the content rely on transformations that are done via database triggers. If we 
can extract the content to s3 via events from a database (see [rap-spike-concourse][rap-spike-concourse]) we can then serve the content as static files
or any other method we dream of.

Once published content is able to be served and is no longer in the database we can start to
remove the database triggers from the database and use them in a more maintainable fashion.

### Epics, Stories, and Task Cards (DO)

* Determine how to do individual (or group) development of AWS
* [Determine the s3 data structure in order to be served as a book.](https://app.zenhub.com/workspace/o/openstax/cnx/issues/655)
* [Develop a wsgi app utilizing zappa and AWS Lambda that serves content from s3](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/content-engineering-tech-team-5af1f4cc12da5e6d74331b60/issues/openstax/cnx/657)

 
### Confirmation (CHECK)

Given: a url w/ the full ident_hash  
Then: content to be served directly from s3 / cloudfront  

Given: a url w/ a missing book version  
Then: the lambda function to determine the content to be served by redirecting to s3 (the full ident hash) and getting the latest version  

Given: 400,000 IDs in one S3 directory (40 books * 200 pages per book * 50 versions)  
Then: S3 will not explode  

Given: a url of format archive.openstax.org/contents/<book_uuid>@<version>:<page_uuid>  
Then: return the proper json  

### Follow up (ACT)

## Using Cloudformation

### Articles that are useful

- [AWS CloudFormation Documentation][aws-cloudformation]
- [Managing Lambda@Edge and CloudFront deployments by using a CI/CD pipeline][aws-cf-lambda-ci]
- [Amazon S3 + Amazon CloudFront: A Match Made in the Cloud][aws-cf-s3]
- [Chalice CloudFormation Support][aws-chalice-support]
- [Chalice Pure Lambda Functions][aws-chalice-pure-lambda]
- [AWS Serverless Application Model][aws-sam]

### Create the distribution, buckets, and policies

To create the distribution run the following using the `aws` cli:

    aws cloudformation deploy --template-file cf-templates/cf-cloudfront-content-buckets.yaml --region us-east-1 --stack-name ce-distribution --tags Project=rap-spike-lambda Application=rap-spike-lambda Environment=dev Owner=Mike

### Customizing for developer use

Each developer could create a copy of the template file to create their own cloudfront distribution and buckets.

## Loading the books into s3

Follow the instructions in [./dump/README.md](./dump/README.md) file.
